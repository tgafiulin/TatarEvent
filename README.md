## Privacy Policy

This Chrome extension, “TatarEvent 2.0”, does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data about you on external servers. The extension only modifies the appearance and behavior of pages on the jevent.jugru.org website in your browser in order to hide other reviewers’ scores and comments, display how many reviewers have already voted for each proposal, and store draft reviews (score, resolution, and comment) locally in your browser to protect against losing input. All processing happens locally in your browser and no information is sent to any external servers other than jevent.jugru.org as part of the normal site functionality.

If you have any questions, contact: t.gafiulin@yandex.ru.
